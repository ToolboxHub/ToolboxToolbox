classdef TbIncludeStrategy < TbToolboxStrategy
    % Take transitive closure of "include" records.
    %
    % TbIncludeStrategy is a special-case strategy.  It is not supposed to
    % be used in the normal way with obatin/update.  In fact, these
    % operations are errors.
    %
    % Instead, this strategy inspects a given config and transitively
    % resolves additional records indicated by "inluced" records.  The
    % result is one big, fat, flat config which closes over the "includes".
    % This simplifies subsequent deploys.  It also gives us a chance to
    % prevent "include" loops.
    %
    % Also, we want included configs to be treated the same as
    % other configs.  In order for tbDeployToolboxes to do this
    % correctly, we need to use the same values for parameters like
    % toolboxRoot.  The obtain and update methods would not be able to see
    % these values, so we'd get unexpected default behavior for includes.
    %
    % Also, we don't care to store the "include" config itself in the
    % toolboxes folder.  What we really want to store are the included
    % toolboxes.
